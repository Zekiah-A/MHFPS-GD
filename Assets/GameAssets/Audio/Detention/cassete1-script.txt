Don't listen to him! I wish I could tell you that this were a normal detention, but that is not the case. I don't know who you are, or how long I've been here, but- I'll make it quick. I may not make it, but I can warn you. There's something with the teachers, they're not themselves. Do not wait, the clock will NEVER strike six as long as you don't let it, because if you do, stainton will get you. And that bunsen burner or whatever, you will need it on to work, but be careful it attracts Nan. I have also seen the watcher here, through that window on the far right wall, pointing at him usually does the trick, THEY'RE COMING HEL- OH AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, there's this guy short, blonde, I have no idea who he is, but if you see him, CLOSE THE DOORS, DO NOT LET HIM IN. OH crap... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
